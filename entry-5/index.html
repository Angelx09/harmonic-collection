     <h3>BeiBei's past diary</h3> 
      <div class="notes"><h1>11.03.2025</h1> Today I went out to explore the field and all I could see was green. I wasn't alone, I walked around with Blankie, I walked in circles and circles and circles.... I saw pretty skys with rainbow clouds and a pink little house. Today was a fun day, but mom told me it was time for bed. That made me sad. --BeiBei</div>
      <div class="notes"><h1>11.04.2025</h1> Hi my dear diary, did you look at the beautiful stars tonight? It was sooooo bright just like my tall green lamp! I love my lamp, it keeps me company at night when the world is quiet. Good night --BeiBei</div>
      <div class="notes"><h1>11.05.2025</h1> Dear diary, mom got me a huge teddy bear! It is so fluffy and it is my new best friend! don't tell blankie, but blankie is still my favorite. Now i have both teddy and blankie to sleep with. I feel happy today yayyyyy. good bye --BeiBei</div>
      <div class="notes"><h1>11.06.2025</h1> Hi diary it's me again. Last night I heard the wind blowing against my window and it was quiet nice. I imagine a big human was blowing by my window. I remember when it was raining at night that made me fell a slept very fast, it felt like tickling noise to my ears it was very comfortable. Right now there is birds chriping outside saying it is time to wake up! --BeiBei</div>
